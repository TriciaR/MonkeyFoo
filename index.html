      Consider creating a visualization between
      the the transfer of data between the two
      branches. And then when you've made
      a ton of changes in one branch... you're
      ultimately going to merge those changes
      to the MASTER and then to GH-PAGES

      <b>MASTER is the production branch.
      GH-PAGE is the hosting branch for the site on github.</b>

      BUT you're going to use MASTER for
      the production branch, which means
      that making a STAGING branch would be good for
      a development branch.

      At this point you should be working with
      all the files and you'll be making sure that you're pushing
      the right stuff to the MASTER BRANCH.
      FINGERS CROSSED!

      REMIND YOURSELF:
      WHICH BRANCH AM I WORKING ON?

      AND IF I HAVE TO MERGE WORK
      FROM ONE BRANCH INTO ANOTHER?
      WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

      Remember:
      MASTER IS the MAIN BRANCH
      and other branches can be used for making experiments, changes, whatever you wish.

      IF you want to commit that experiment work  to the MASTER branch,
      THEN you merge the changes into the MASTER branch.
      But you have to remember to save all the work: 'git add', 'git commit',
      and perhaps push that brach to github:
      git push origin name_of_branch

      <i>IF you don't want the work in the experiment branch to ever reach the master branch.
      DELETE the experiment branch and you're good.
      Never goes the MASTER BRANCH, and can then get deleted.</i>

      //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

      TIPS:
      - DO NOT WORK in the GH-PAGES branch.
      - WORK PRIMARILY FROM OTHER BRANCHES
        starting from MASTER.
      - Then merge the work from the other branch into MASTER.
      - Then checkout Gh-pages and
      - MERGE MASTER into GH-PAGES...

      ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

      This will be how you get up to speed
      to Git + Github... PRACTICE.

      $ mkdr some_folder
      $ cd some_folder
      $ git init
      $ git commit -m "first commit"
      $ touch index.html
      $ mkdir css
      $ cd css
      $ touch styles.css
      $ cd ..
      $ ls
      $ subl index.html
      # then work here in the master branch and when ready switch branches
      $ git status
      $ git add .
      or
      $ git add name_of_asset
      $ git commit -m "the commit message"
      # create a repo on github and push to the remote repository
      $ git push -u path-to-branch-on-github
      $  git checkout -b new_branch
      # code a piece of functionality and save work:
      $ git status
      $ git add .
      $ git commit -m
      $ git push origin new_branch
      $ git checkout master
      $ git merge new_branch master

      # AND REPEAT until you feel confident!!
